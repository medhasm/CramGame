By : Medhat , Aseel Nemer , Oday 

*  Cram game is a combinatorial game so that: 
1. Two players play 2. The moves allowed for each player depend solely and on where he is and not on the other player.
3. The only difference between player 1 and player 2 is that player 1 goes first.
4. The player who does not find where to place the "L", loses. In other words the last supporter is the winner.

# project goals:
To solve a new version of Cram game by Sprague-Grundy theory.
And to allow people who are interested in thinking games and math games to play this game with a computer or another person. other goal is to have a fun game . 


* Sprague–Grundy theorem states that every impartial  game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a one-heap game of nim,
or to an infinite generalization of nim.The Sprague-Grundy function assigns to each position in a game a natural number
